# Java-Collections

java-collections represents a unified library for storing and manipulating groups of object. This implementation offer a variety of representations, including:

arrays (ArrayList) - have the properties of random-access memory(because array works at the index basis): very fast for accessing elements by position and for iterating over them, but slower for inserting and removing elements at arbitrary positions because require adjusting the position of other elements. 
linked lists (LinkedList) - accessing elements by position is slow, because you have to follow the reference chain from the start of the list, but insertion and removal operations can be performed in constant time by rearranging the cell references.
